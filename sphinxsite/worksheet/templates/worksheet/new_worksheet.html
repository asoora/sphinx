This generated a great deal of resistance. To the service representatives, learning to sell was a very different game from what they had benn playing. But it turned out they already knew a lot more about sales than they thought. For example, the first step in servicing or installing equipment is talking with the clients to understand how they used th equipment. The same is true in selling. The salesperson first has to learn about the customer's needs. The service representatives also had a great deal of product knowledge and hands-on experience, which is obviously important in sales.</textarea>
